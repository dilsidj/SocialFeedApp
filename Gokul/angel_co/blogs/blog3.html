                    <p>It feels like the rise of remote works has been a top conversation in tech for years, but despite the enthusiasm and attention it receives, we've yet to turn the corner on making remote work a norm.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="elements">
                    <p>AngelList Founder Naval Ravikant, however, says he thinks remote work's time is coming. “It is probably going to be the single most important new category in hiring,” he says.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="elements">
                    <p>When pressed further, he offered the following thoughts:</p>

                <div class="elements">
                    <h2 id="heading1">On why traditional, on-premise work can be counter-productive</h2>

                <div class="elements">
                    <p>“Nothing is going to replace in-person, human warmth and communication. When two humans are in a room next to each other, they communicate at a much higher bandwidth through all kinds of subtle, physical signals than they do over video. And even that's much greater than over audio. This hidden, high-bandwidth human communication is only possible in person.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="elements">
                    <p>“But you don't need that all the time. When you're sitting at your desk, you know what to do, and you just have work to crank it out, but your boss walks by, you're suddenly going to have this high-bandwidth communication whether you like it or not. It's going to suck a lot of energy out of you. Or maybe you're not feeling super productive today, and you'd rather work on Saturday. You don't get that choice. Yeah, you can not show up, and you might have a flexible work environment, but there's still the social pressure of, 'My desk is sitting empty while everybody else's in the office.'”</p>

                <div class="elements">

                    <p>“We're going to see an era of everyone employing remote tech workers, and it's not too far away. In fact, now's the time to prepare for it. But I think in the meantime, the companies that are going to do the best job at it are the ones that are remote companies or that have divisions internally that are remote. It's going to be done through lengthy trials. It's going to be done through new forms of evaluating whether someone can work remotely effectively.”</p>

                    <p>“Crypto is interesting because these crypto companies are open-source projects for the most part...and because it's decentralized in nature. It's kind of a global movement with mathematicians and cryptographers and hackers working on it. By its nature, it ends up being much more distributed, much more remote.</p>

                <div class="elements">
                    <p>“These are obviously very engineering-heavy cultures, and it's easier to do engineering work remotely than other kinds, unfortunately, but that will change. But crypto companies also have a culture of meeting regularly in interesting locations. There's always an interesting blockchain conference going on, so you find the one that's in a nice spot where everybody wants to meet, and everybody flies in.</p>
